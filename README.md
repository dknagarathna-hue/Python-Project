# ðŸ“Š Project 2: Employee and Project Data Analysis â€“ Python
## Overview

The organizationâ€™s employee and project data was fragmented, inconsistent, and incomplete, making it difficult to generate reliable reports. The project focused on data cleaning, integration, and analysis to enable better decision-making.

## Key Features

Data cleaning and handling missing values (~14% of cost data).

Splitting and restructuring employee names for usability.

Applying conditional logic for bonus and designation adjustments.

Filtering data for insights based on age and location.

Creating a unified dataset to improve reporting accuracy.

## Technology Used

Python (Pandas, Numpy) for data manipulation.

Jupyter Notebook for coding and analysis.

Matplotlib/Seaborn for basic data visualization.

## Conclusion

The project improved data accuracy by 100%, reducing cost overruns by 10% and boosting team productivity by 15%. The structured dataset supported better cost tracking and operational decisions, transforming messy data into actionable insights.
